They knew what was going to take place! Then the city of Charlottesville was also in charge of setting up the location. This same city of Charlottesville was the one's giving the law enforcement their orders...which was stand down! The order to stand down was revoked once white supremacist/Neo-Nazis/KKK filled the location. Keep in mind one-way in and only one-way out now. But before revoking the order to stand down they allowed BLM an Antifa to completely block in the location. Another kicker all this took place on George Soros birthday to top things off. He's been known to hangout in the Charlottesville Virginia area more than once now. He also funds groups such as the KKK Antifa Neo-Nazis BLM etc etc etc. And all the while fund politicians such as the Clintons Obama's and so forth. Now let's also keep in mind this same man helps fund banks as big as American Bank etc. He literally was willing and did pay out 200dllrs a month to protesters with dental an health care benefits during and after the election. He's also tied to bussing in thousands of people to riot the streets of Washington DC during the inauguration as well as spending more than $750,000 on just marijuana that was altered with chemicals to be passed out on the streets during the inauguration. Yes I'm very sure other political parties were involved by the mass numbers but big George is the main target here."	2017-08-17T19:02:07+0000	7

How To Create A Social State ... by Saul Alinsky Saul David Alinsky (January 30, 1909 ‚Äì June 12, 1972) was an American community organizer and writer. He is generally considered to be the founder of modern community organizing. He is often noted for his book Rules for Radicals. There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state. The first is the most important. 1) Healthcare ‚Äì Control healthcare and you control the people 2) Poverty ‚Äì Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live. 3) Debt ‚Äì Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty. 4) Gun Control ‚Äì Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state. 5) Welfare ‚Äì Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income) 6) Education ‚Äì Take control of what people read and listen to ‚Äì take control of what children learn in school. 7) Religion ‚Äì Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools. 8) Class Warfare ‚Äì Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor. Does any of this sound familiar???"	2017-08-17T16:46:12+0000	20

The History of the Arlington National Cemetery.   Repost from Raymond Bartlett:  Robert E Lee was married to George Washington's granddaughter. He worked with Grant during the Mexican-American war and became a decorated war hero defending this country He believed slavery was a great evil and his wife broke the law by teaching slaves to read and write. After the civil war he worked with Andrew Johnson's program of reconstruction. He became very popular with the northern states and the Barracks at West Point were named in his honor in 1962. He was a great man who served this country his entire life in some form or other. His memorial is now being called a blight. No American military veteran should be treated as such. People keep yelling, ""You can't change history."" Sadly you can. This is no better than book burnings. ISIS tried rewriting history by destroying historical artifacts. Is that really who we want to emulate?  As they tear down this ""blight"" keep these few historical facts in your mind. No military veteran and highly decorated war hero should ever be treated as such. This is not Iraq and that is not a statue of Sadam.  IN ADDITION:: Lee was also very torn about the prospect of the South leaving the Union. His wifes grandfather George Washington was a huge influence on him. He believed that ultimately, states rights trumped the federal government and chose to lead the Southern army. His estate, Arlington, near Washington DC was his home and while away fighting the war, the federal government demanded that Lee himself pay his taxes in person. He sent his wife but the money was not accepted from a woman. When he could not pay the taxes, the government began burying dead Union soldiers on his land. The government is still burying people there today. It is now called Arlington National Cemetery. DO THEY WANT TO TEAR THAT UP ALSO ??"	2017-08-17T16:50:38+0000	8

Tony Schwartz, Trump‚Äôs former ghostwriter for Trump‚Äôs book ‚ÄúArt of The Deal‚Äù, is saying he thinks Trump is laying the groundwork for his resignation. Schwartz said, ‚ÄúThe circle is closing at blinding speed. Trump is going to resign and declare victory before Mueller and Congress leave him no choice.‚Äù This man spent a massive chunk of time with Trump while writing for him over recent years. He probably understands Trump‚Äôs headspace better than anyone, so his assessment of the situation can be given a considerable amount of weight. Trump thinks he can take credit for the economy and stock market that were set into motion by President Obama and imaginary jobs that he claims to have created, so in Trump‚Äôs mind, he can claim that he has had a successful 6 months and ride off into the sunset as a success. He may see resigning now like quitting while he‚Äôs ahead. While no one else would see it that way, Trump‚Äôs clearly comfortable believing what he wants despite the reality that everyone else sees. If he resigns now, despite what he thinks, the ongoing investigations into his crimes would not just come to a halt. So while we can all hope the resignation is coming soon, we can bet it won‚Äôt be the end of Trump taking over our headlines."	2017-08-17T16:33:25+0000	8

If they take down anything to do with the civil war and slavery... Then they need to remove any reference to people such as Harriet Tubman,William Still and John Brown... There was no Sojourner Truth,Fredrick Douglas,Rosa Parks or MLK... If we erase the Civil War and the mistakes that were made... Then we must wipe out history from April 12, 1861 until present day... if the civil war statues come down then every and all statues must come down... Because we can't explain the good to our generations to come without explaining the bad... And it's apparent this generation cannot handle the truth... So I will offer my help in removing the MLK statue in DC... And burning of any books with reference to Harriet Tubman,John Brown,Sojourner Truth and MLK and any other civil rights participate... So let's get this done as to shield our youth of today... I have to say,I'm feeling positive about this... We will live in a world now where slavery never existed,never a proclamation emancipation,no civil war,none of those pesky civil right marches,those mean and scary statues... From now on only happy history... all new statues will be of rainbows and unicorns... And all those schools and streets name after confederate leaders and civil rights marchers will be gone... And in their place will be jellybean lane, happyville circle and smiley street... And if any mention of the bad evil time will lead to punishment of listening to all of obamas teleprompter speeches... This is how the left and our youth of today want it...So let's get it started..."	2017-08-17T15:53:12+0000	16

If you've noticed the influx of negative comments at the top of posts in your news feed, Facebook changed its algorithm so the posts with the most comments instead of the most likes sit at the top. This new Facebook policy is feeding the trolls.  There are a couple things we can do to help. 1. People need to quit responding to the paid and not paid trolls, then they won't get the top comment spot in a thread. They won't get the attention and responses they are craving. 2. DO respond in the comments section of posts you agree with, even if it is just one word. As long as the pertinent posts are receiving more comments than the troll posts, then the troll posts will be relegated to the bottom,  where they belong.

They are looking good, just as they did under Obama his last 4 years, but there are storm clouds on the horizon.  Credit card debt is back up over 1 trillion dollars and credit card default rates are rising.  Consumer spending, which is the single biggest driver of the economy and jobs, has been flat for some weeks now as shown by the charts on XLY (an ETF that tracks consumer discretionary spending) and XLP (an ETF that tracks consumer staples spending).  We do not yet have a Trump tax plan, a Trump jobs plan, a Trump budget or a Trump infrastructure plan passed by Congress.

The haters waste so much time out of their lives knocking our president.  So I wonder .. do they have a life, a job, a family, own a home?  Where were they when obama send plane loads of tax paying dollars to Iran, lying about Benghazi, lying for crooked hillary, lying about Lynch, 100's of golf vacations on tax paying dollars and the list can go on and on.  For god's sake obama was an activist and that's it.  He took over 5 million from George Soros to be elected and change American policies. Good job obama.  You recreated race in America.  You divided more people than any president in us history! Where was Rich Klein and the haters then .. probably looking for a job .. home in foreclosure . on welfare, food stamps ..  Today we have a president who doesn't get paid a dime to put up with classless, clueless bunch of haters.  He was highly successful before being president!  Read the ""Art of the Deal"".  Written 25 to 30 years ago and he loved America then and still does.  So for all the haters - learn to have some respect for your president and your country.  You can be hater on facebook and you'll get your 2 minutes of fame but I guarantee you're hateful in other ways.  God help your children, family and friends."	2017-08-17T16:26:42+0000	0

Trump needs to ignore the Russia nonsense, and not have his family advising him. We elected him to run the country, not his family. Repeal the 17th amendment, so people in rural areas of the country can have better representation. The majority of the country is red, with big cities being small blue spots on the map. Fix the problems with social security. Audit the federal reserve, and get the IRS under control. Try to do something about tax reform. Pass the El Chapo bill proposed by Ted Cruz to help pay for the wall. End the DACA amnesty, get rid of MS-13 gang members, disallow illegal aliens from having a bank account, cancel the H1B and H2B Visa programs, always do proper vetting, pull funding from sanctuary cities, and enforce all travel visas. Re instate the travel ban from dangerous countries. Get the government out of healthcare, have it function like car insurance, get big pharmaceutical and big insurance under control, get enormous malpractice settlements under control and get some doctors' and CEOs' wages under control. Abolish the Federal department of education, end affirmative action, repeal teacher's tenure, pass school vouchers, pull funding from universities like Berkeley, and have scholarship tax credit programs available in all 50 states. Investigate Lynch for pressuring Comey to go easy on Hillary, Holder for the Fast and Furious scandal, the Clinton foundation, and Obama/Rice for unmasking. Investigate voter fraud. Get rid of the rules of engagement in our military. China, Japan, and South Korea need to take responsibility for North Korea. We need to stop being so close with Saudi Arabia, they are NOT our allies. Don't ever sell good quality weapons to our enemies, and don't buy middle eastern oil, it funds terrorism. Start innovating with science, to eventually get us away from fossil fuel consumption. Unsign the UN small arms treaty, pull funding from the UN, and leave. Start a new UN where only countries with at least 10 years of functioning stable governments, free elections, and freedom of the press can join. Stop giving out billions in foreign aid, because the money never actually goes to the people who need it the most."	2017-08-17T16:06:09+0000	1

Total anarchy and the people are not being represented by their Governors and Mayors. It does absolutely no good to remove these statues from history. There was so much more to the Civil War than slavery. People need to educate themselves. Robert E Lee graduated from the United States Military Academy (West Point) and served our nation well during the Mexican/American War. He was an excellent strategist. He served on the board of West Point. Even though he didn't favor slavery he made the difficult decision to fight with his home state of Virginia. I am so angered at the removal of these patriotic symbols from low lifes that don't work, have been taught Liberal values in school and really should just leave this country instead of tearing it down.

My parents taught me early on to treat people the way I wanted to be treated.

Other countries are laughing at the divide in the U.S.  People are begging to be a part of our free will country.  Countless men and women in uniform are risking their lives (including my step daughter who  is deployed as we speak) and many have paid the ultimate price and lost their life just so you can rant like an idiot, rest like a baby and eat like a king.  You have the freedom to act as you want due to the many selfless sacrifices others are making for you and you choose to act barbaric.  I pray daily for this country, the citizens and the leadership.  However, I do not blame the individuals acting out.   I blame your parents/guardians.  Respect starts at home.  Obedience starts at home.  Love starts at home.  I can almost bet the majority of the chaotic outbursts are from people who did not respect their care givers growing up.  It's sad.

Additionally, under U.S. Public Law 810, Approved by the 17th Congress on 26 Feb 1929 the War Department was directed to erect headstones and recognize Confederate grave sites as U.S. War dead grave sites. Just for the record the last Confederate veteran died in 1958. So, in essence, when you remove a Confederate statue, monument or headstone, you are in fact, removing a statue, monument or head stone of a U.S. VETERAN.  It is my opinion that the Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. marshal's should be arresting people that are desecrating memorials including Statues of U.S. veterans including, according the Federal Law, Confederate soldiers. This would include any state or local government that does so"	2017-08-17T14:53:30+0000	20

Nothing could actually be further from the truth. The War Between the States began because the South demanded States' rights and were not getting them.  The Congress at that time heavily favored the industrialized northern states to the point of demanding that the South sell is cotton and other raw materials only to the factories in the north, rather than to other countries. The Congress also taxed the finished materials that the northern industries produced heavily, making finished products that the South wanted, unaffordable. The Civil War should not have occurred. If the Northern States and their representatives in Congress had only listened to the problems of the South, and stopped these practices that were almost like the taxation without representation of Great Britain, then the Southern states would not have seceded and the war would not have occurred.   I know for many years, we have been taught that the Civil War was all about the abolition of slavery, but this truly did not become a major issue, with the exception of John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, until after the Battle of Antietam in September 1862, when Abraham Lincoln decided to free the slaves in the Confederate States in order to punish those states for continuing the war effort. The war had been in progress for two years by that time.   Most southerners did not even own slaves nor did they own plantations. Most of them were small farmers who worked their farms with their families. They were fighting for their rights. They were fighting to maintain their lifestyle and their independence the way they wanted to without the United States Government dictating to them how they should behave.   Why are we frequently taught then, that the Civil War, War of Northern Aggression, War Between the States, or whatever you want to call it, was solely about slavery? That is because the history books are usually written by the winners of a war and this war was won by the Union. the Civil War was about much more than abolishing the institution of slavery.   It was more about preserving the United States and protecting the rights of the individual, the very tenets upon which this country was founded. I personally think that the people who profess that the Civil War was only fought about slavery have not read their history books. I really am glad that slavery was abolished, but I don't think it should be glorified as being the sole reason the Civil War was fought. There are so many more issues that people were intensely passionate about at the time. Slavery was one of them, but it was not the primary cause of the war. The primary causes of the war were economics and states' rights."	2017-08-17T16:09:41+0000	2

You may not agree with a particular protest, or march, or rally but that doesn't give you the right to show up and cause s riot. I may not agree with certain protests or causes, but I've never shown up and tried to cause those people harm. Regardless of how repugnant I think their cause is. My country promises freedom of speech. If that freedom is used to do harm to others or incite violence, it is the job of local authorities to determine how that should be dealt with, not an angry mob. I can't believe that no one is making this clear, but I shouldn't be surprised. The young woman killed by that lunatic in the car did not have to die. I believe she shouldn't have been there in the first place. Now go ahead and hate me for making sense."	2017-08-17T15:22:28+0000	2

Robert E Lee was married to George Washington's granddaughter.   He worked with Grant during the Mexican-American war and became a decorated war hero defending this country .  He believed slavery was a great evil and his wife broke the law by teaching slaves to read and write.   After the civil war he worked with Andrew Johnson's program of reconstruction.   He became very popular with the northern states and the Barracks at West Point were named in his honor in 1962.   He was a great man who served this country his entire life in some form or other.   His memorial is now being called a blight. No American military veteran should be treated as such.   People keep yelling, ""You can't change history."" Sadly you can. This is no better than book burnings. ISIS tried rewriting history by destroying historical artifacts. Is that really who we want to emulate?   As they tear down this ""blight"" keep these few historical facts in your mind.   No military veteran and highly decorated war hero should ever be treated as such. This is not Iraq and that is not a statue of Sadam.  IN ADDITION:: Lee was also very torn about the prospect of the South leaving the Union.   His wifes grandfather George Washington was a huge influence on him.   He believed that ultimately, states rights trumped the federal government and chose to lead the Southern army.   His estate, Arlington, near Washington DC was his home and while away fighting the war, the federal government demanded that Lee himself pay his taxes in person. He sent his wife but the money was not accepted from a woman.   When he could not pay the taxes, the government began burying dead Union soldiers on his land. The government is still burying people there today. It is now called Arlington National Cemetery.  DO THEY WANT TO TEAR THAT UP ALSO ??"	2017-08-17T17:32:33+0000	2

How is that, you may ask? ‚ÄúThey gathered all 4 groups (BLM, Antifa, Neo-Nazis and KKK) in the streets of Charlottesville since those groups really belong to their party and ordered law enforcement to not interfere, because they knew the end result would be tragic and at the end of the day they can turn it around and blame President Trump for it, just like they have and in the process the Liberal Media would have a field day! At the end of the day Trump had nothing to do with the tragedy that took place.   It was a perfectly planned political move by the democrats and their plan sadly worked. They‚Äôre playing real dirty and evil strategic politics on President Trump behind the scenes, because they hate him so much and they will do anything in their power to ruin him. President Trump has to order a full FBI Investigation on BLM, Antifa Groups and Globalist George Soros (their funder) and check their servers, emails etc and I'm sure they'll find some kind of paper trail that it was all planned by the Dems to begin with. The Governor of Virginia is a Democrat. #WereNotStupid #ItTimeToPutAnEnd #ToEvilLiberalPolitics #MAGA"	2017-08-17T11:46:15+0000	51

CONFEDERATE FLAGS? CROSS BURNING?, PORNOGRAPHY? NAMBLA? WESTBORO BAPTIST CHURCH? ANYTHING ELSE YOU DEEM OFFENSIVE?  Well I completely understand but ALL THESE THINGS ARE PROTECTED UNDER THE 1ST AMENDMENT! Freedom of speech, the press, association, assembly, and petition: This set of guarantees, protected by the First Amendment, comprises what we refer to as freedom of expression. It is the foundation of a vibrant democracy, and without it, other fundamental rights, like the right to vote, would wither away. This protection includes individuals engaged in some truly offensive speech. Whether YOU like it or not this includes the speech rights of Communists, Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members, NAMBLA, accused terrorists, pornographers, anti-LGBT activists, and flag burners. That‚Äôs because the defense of freedom of speech is most necessary when the message is one most people find repulsive. Constitutional rights must apply to even the most unpopular groups if they‚Äôre going to be preserved for everyone."	2017-08-17T12:06:59+0000	7

He hasn‚Äôt, and says he never will.  3. He said he‚Äôd divest himself from his financial empire, to avoid any conflicts of interest. You bought it. He is still heavily involved in his businesses, manipulates the stock market on a daily basis, and has more conflicts of interest than can even be counted. 4. He said Clinton was in the pockets of Goldman Sachs, and would do whatever they said. You bought it. He then proceeded to put half a dozen Goldman Sachs executives in positions of power in his administration.  5. He said he‚Äôd surround himself with all the best and smartest people. You bought it. He nominated theocratic loon Mike Pence for Vice President. A white supremacist named Steve Bannon is his most trusted confidant. Dr. Ben Carson, the world‚Äôs greatest idiot savant brain surgeon, is in charge of HUD. Russian quisling Rex Tillerson is Secretary of State.‚Äù  ‚Äú6. He said he‚Äôd be his own man, beholden to no one. You bought it.

He said he knew more about strategy and terrorism than the Generals did. You bought it. He promptly gave the green light to a disastrous raid in Yemen- even though all his Generals said it would be a terrible idea. This raid resulted in the deaths of a Navy SEAL, an 8-year old American girl, and numerous civilians. The actual target of the raid escaped, and no useful intel was gained.  9. He said Hillary Clinton couldn‚Äôt be counted on in times of crisis. You bought it. He didn‚Äôt even bother overseeing that raid in Yemen; and instead spent the time hate-tweeting the New York Times, and sleeping.  10. He called CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and said they were his enemy. You bought it. He now gets all his information from Breitbart, Gateway Pundit, and InfoWars.  11. He called Barack Obama ‚Äúthe vacationer-in-Chief‚Äù and accused him of playing more rounds of golf than Tiger Woods. He promised to never be the kind of president who took cushy vacations on the taxpayer‚Äôs dime, not when there was so much important work to be done. You bought it.

FREEDOM IN NEVER FREE  Have you ever wondered what happened to the 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence?  Five signers were captured by the British as traitors, and tortured before they died.  Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned.  Two lost their sons serving in the Revolutionary Army; another had two sons captured.  Nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds or hardships of the Revolutionary War.  They signed and they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.  What kind of men were they?  Twenty-four were lawyers and jurists.  Eleven were merchants, nine were farmers and large plantation owners; men of means, well educated, but they signed the Declaration of Independence knowing full well that the penalty would be death if they were captured.  Carter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter and trader, saw his Ships swept from the seas by the British Navy. He sold his home and properties to pay his debts, and died in rags.  Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move his family almost constantly.  He served in the Congress without pay, and his family was kept in hiding.  His possessions were taken from him, and poverty was his reward.  Vandals or soldiers looted the properties of Dillery, Hall, Clymer, Walton, Gwinnett, Heyward, Ruttledge, and Middleton.  At the battle of Yorktown, Thomas Nelson, Jr., noted that the British General Cornwallis had taken over the Nelson home for his headquarters.  He quietly urged General George Washington to open fire. The home was destroyed, and Nelson died bankrupt.  Francis Lewis had his home and properties destroyed.  The enemy jailed his wife, and she died within a few months.  John Hart was driven from his wife's bedside as she was dying.  Their 13 children fled for their lives.  His fields and his gristmill were laid to waste.  For more than a year he lived in forests and caves, returning home to find his wife dead and his children vanished.  Some of us take these liberties so much for granted, but we shouldn't.  So, take a few minutes while enjoying your freedom and silently thank these patriots.  It's not much to ask for the price they paid.  Remember: freedom is never free!"	2017-08-17T12:29:44+0000	2

No man can stand or withstand the onslaught of all that has come against this man. It is greater than anything the flesh can muster in defense. ONLY THE LORD and the power of His might will bring this evil to nought! Lord.. for each pit they dig for President Trump to fall into, cause them to fall into it according to your Word. Give them each something else to keep them busy in life so they have no time to do the evil works they do. For those who would repent O Lord, bring them under Your banner that they may serve You for good and not for evil. Those who will not.. level them O Lord and destroy their works all of their efforts! There is an evil root of rich men who use Your living souls for their wicked pleasure.. kill these evil roots O Lord that the branches may also wither and die. Protect our President, his family, his cabinet and all who serve America with a pure heart and a standard that is pleasing to You. Send forth Your warring angels this morning O Lord and escort these demons that work in the hearts and minds of men and seal them in the abyss, stripped of all power that they rise not again.. in Jesus' name!

Basically, it had local police profiling people in its community and running checks on their immigration status for things like a broken headlight on their car. We thought it was a terrible idea because it made local residents wary of working with local police to improve public safety, and we said so out loud. However, for a couple of years, we had no choice but to comply with the Secure Communities program and that is exactly what we did. What eventually happened is various organizations and individuals took it to court and won decisions that Secure Communities violated the 4th Amendment, prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures. On top of that, the policies around the program evolved to where states and municipalities could opt out of the program. So we opted out. Later in 2014, the Secure Communities program was discontinued.  The big picture is we worked within the framework of the law to opt out of what was eventually deemed an overreaching and ineffective program. The same framework applies to Somerville's sanctuary city status. It is bulwarked by legal precedent. The easiest way to think of it is that local police do not act as direct representatives of federal agencies - ICE, the IRS, the EPA, etc. There are limits to how much legwork local authorities have to do on behest of those agencies. In the case of ICE, Somerville does work with immigration authorities to take deportation action against those who have committed serious crimes (e.g. assault), but we do not operate like an ICE field office outside of that. Legally speaking, we are on extremely firm ground with that policy."	2017-08-17T11:12:26+0000	1

As soon as they were in contact with each other, we were told to stand down. It was outrageous. We weren‚Äôt allowed to arrest anyone without asking the mayor first. We weren‚Äôt even allowed to stop the driver as he sped away.‚Äú ‚ÄúThe event was being set up as far back as at least May and it went like clockwork.‚Äù Michael Signer, the mayor of Charlottesville, ordered police to stand down during the most chaotic and destructive period of the protests ‚Äì despite police protests against the orders. ‚ÄúWe wanted to do our job and keep the peace. But these mother******s in charge really want to destroy America.‚Äù Fox News reporter Doug McKelway was on the scene in Charlottesville and he backs up the police officer‚Äôs claims. ‚ÄúI can say, having been in Emancipation Park from early on that morning, that what I saw with my own two eyes confirms what this law enforcement source told us.

This new Facebook policy is feeding the trolls. There are a couple things we can do to help. 1. People need to quit responding to the trolls, then they won't get the top comment spot in a thread. They won't get the attention and responses they are craving. 2. DO respond in the comments section of posts you agree with, even if it is just one word. As long as the pertinent posts are receiving more comments than the troll posts, then the troll posts will be relegated to the bottom, where they belong.

He worked with Grant during the Mexican-American war and became a decorated war hero defending this country He believed slavery was a great evil and his wife broke the law by teaching slaves to read and write. After the civil war he worked with Andrew Johnson's program of reconstruction. He became very popular with the northern states and the Barracks at West Point were named in his honor in 1962. He was a great man who served this country his entire life in some form or other. His memorial is now being called a blight. No American military veteran should be treated as such. People keep yelling, ""You can't change history."" Sadly you can. This is no better than book burnings. ISIS tried rewriting history by destroying historical artifacts. Is that really who we want to emulate?  As they tear down this ""blight"" keep these few historical facts in your mind. No military veteran and highly decorated war hero should ever be treated as such. This is not Iraq and that is not a statue of Sadam.  IN ADDITION:: Lee was also very torn about the prospect of the South leaving the Union. His wifes grandfather George Washington was a huge influence on him. He believed that ultimately, states rights trumped the federal government and chose to lead the Southern army. His estate, Arlington, near Washington DC was his home and while away fighting the war, the federal government demanded that Lee himself pay his taxes in person. He sent his wife but the money was not accepted from a woman. When he could not pay the taxes, the government began burying dead Union soldiers on his land. The government is still burying people there today. It is now called Arlington National Cemetery.  DO THEY WANT TO TEAR THAT UP ALSO ??"	2017-08-16T23:16:01+0000	2

Then laid blame where it belonged for the terrible events in Charlottesville! With all that showed up there hell bent on violence! Hate has many flavors, none less bitter than the other!!   There were whites there protesting the removal of that statue without an ounce of hatred or support for slavery/oppression and so on. They were there simply to honor the memory of their fallen ancestors! They were just as much victims of the supremacists (on both sides) as anyone else! Just like there were people on the other side who came with hatred in their hearts and wanted to punish anyone for supporting the confederacy.   I absolutely deplore being hated for being born white so dispel any forms of hatred! That said, we are all human, live differently, have different morals and beliefs and by all means different cultures. Is one better than another? Nope, just different!!   There are some 7.44 billion people on this planet with no two who are exactly alike!! If I hate rap music and don't find people of other races attractive, that don't mean I hate someone, it means I choose not to live that way and don't care to live around people who do! To be forced to do so violates my God given right to the pursuit of happiness! Does that mean I don't tolerate their culture or respect their right to live differently than how I choose to? Absolutely not and most definitely does not mean I hate them or think I am better than them!! I am just as different to them as they are to me! Problem is that my choice to be different is not accepted but their brand is? How is that right?    A recent ""racial"" incident in a town near me is a prime example of whats wrong with society today. In many different ways it is! Some young teens decided to spray paint racial slurs on cars. Anti black sayings on cars of blacks, anti-white sayings on cars of whites. One ""victim"" of their attack demanded justice, made a social firestorm over it, had a press conference and demanded an apology from the mayor. The other one, prayed for the kids (turns out one was 13 and one 14) reported it to police and washed it off their car. See how a heart of love heals and moves on?

After weathering millions of dollars in false attacks, conservative Congressman Mo Brooks (R-AL) came up short yesterday and failed to make the Republican primary runoff for U.S. Senate in Alabama.  Congressman Brooks was surging three weeks ago, but the president's surprise endorsement of Luther Strange stalled the congressman's momentum. If Senator Mitch McConnell had not convinced the president to bail his candidate out at the last minute, Congressman Brooks would have made the runoff.  Despite his loss, we are very proud of Congressman Brooks and the spirited campaign that he ran. He was up against a massive political machine that lied to the voters about his record yet he stood strong and fought for conservative principles until the very end.  Mo Brooks displayed the kind of courage and leadership that we need in the Senate if we're ever going to save our country.  Senator Mitch McConnell succeeded in defeating Mo Brooks in this race, but he will ultimately be held accountable. No leader can remain in power by repeatedly lying to the American people.  I want to thank every SCF supporter who contributed to the Brooks for Senate campaign. He is a strong conservative, a valued member of the House Freedom Caucus, and a good man.  Mo Brooks was McConnell's top target in this race because he posed the greatest threat to McConnell's chosen candidate, and I'm extremely proud that we stood with him."	2017-08-16T22:54:07+0000	0

They are helping make customer service non existent. It is not only hurting large retail chains. But mom and pop shops too. Consumers have become lazy and complacent. I worked in retail for 14 years before falling ill. I watched my company spiral downward and struggle to have sales increases. Thus caused them to cut back on hours, and stop providing benefits to their employees. And mostly they lost where they came from. It's hard to come back out on the top when customers can click and buy anything without leaving their recliner. Customer service in general is dying in our country. People are forgetting what it feels like to be treated with dignity and respect. Same goes for the food industry but I won't go there. How are they supposed to know how to treat other people when they never have to face them because they can make all of their purchases online. It's bonkers. I can't say I want Amazon to fail.

But his comment is true - Amazon has some amazing tax breaks - most stuff is purchased without paying sales tax - etc. etc. So here's the fix. Relieve the tax burden of small business - relieve tax payers of paying sales tax and level the playing field. Let the competition be fair in the free market. Don't punish Amazon for going around the tax system - give the small guys the same breaks. Problem solved. Sales tax? Do away with it too. It takes a great percentage of lower income families income anyway. States and localities provide for the basics with what they have available - spending by the government goes down - more spendable income by families. Less money going to the croney system - more money going to business. Business grows - they hire more people - everybody does better. That's how the free market system works.

But for me who lives so far away from the city, someone who is literally in the middle of the woods. Amazon provides me a great service because I'm able to buy things at a fair price that I would have to travel a great distance to get in store. However as a small business owner that pays sales tax on all business I do, Amazon and eBay both need to pay sales tax, and the 3rd party sellers need to also. Yes that would raise the price on stuff but it would still be cheaper for me and alot more convenient than having to travel to the city for items. I believe in a free market economy. But I also believe in a fair tax code. Now I don't blame anyone who takes any tax cuts they legally can to save money, that's just being human and being in business. So on this I disagree in a way but I also agree in a way. Big business should pay higher taxes than small business. It's extremely hard for small business with the regulations and taxes the way they are, big business has loopholes they can take advantage of, I don't blame them for using the loopholes because that is smart business. Let small business compete again against big business and American jobs will come back in droves."	2017-08-16T19:47:07+0000	8

Amazon is based in the U.S., so they are a net gain to the economy just within their cash flow.  The negative side of it is that their business model undercuts almost all other retailers in the country, meaning that while Amazon offers relatively few jobs per unit of goods sold, their competition eliminates comparatively more jobs (per unit of goods sold).  They have a centralized distribution system that eliminates local stores which eliminates local jobs.  That being said, I don't understand why Trump, a capitalist (like myself) is unhappy with this - an American company is competing in the marketplace and winning with a superior business model (from a cost of goods sold perspective).  I suspect his platform here is creating jobs, but I think businesses ought to be allowed to operate efficiently if it can figure out how.  SYNOPSIS: I understand the President wants to create more jobs, but I think its wrong to condemn a successful business model in the process."	2017-08-16T20:13:15+0000	2

The president issued a strong warning against that action and threatened retaliation. The left is now losing its mind, saying it was inflammatory and too strong. They are blaming Trump for the mess. Well hold on kids, cause Uncle Den going to take you to school. In the 50's we had a conflict with North Korea. Our spineless congress at the time would not allow our military to win that conflict. They were afraid of the Chinese getting involved, even though the Chinese were already involved. So congress told our troops, push the enemy back to this line, and stop, go no further, don't actually go in and win. As a result, the war dragged on and on, and in the end, we left with North Korea being communist and a constant threat. We've had american troops on the Korean Border since, Until Obama started pulling them out. For the past 20 years, we've known that North Korea was trying to develop nuclear weapons and working on the missiles to carry them. Slick Willie ignored it,...G.W. sent Jimmy Carter to talk them out of it, Baraack sent them money to bribe them, the U.N. shook its finger and sanctioned them. All worthless. Now Kim Jong has the missiles and probably the warheads to go on them. This is what Trump inherited, not caused. If Kim Jong Dumb actually follows through on his threat, we will have no choice but to respond. That will not be Trumps fault. For over 50 years we've tried diplomacy, and it has failed. So ask yourselves, what would you do in Trump's place. Wait for guam to be hit? Continue the same old same old til they have the ability to hit the U.S.? Send in the special forces to take out Kim Jong? Nuke them? Launch a massive battle to destroy their capital? What would you do? No matter what Trump decides, he will be criticized for it. The only good solution is divine intervention. So if you're afraid, get on your knees and start praying. Don't slam the President for having to deal with a situation half a century in the making. Pray for him to receive wisdom on how to deal with it. And pray for him to receive the tools and opportunities to do so. Class dismissed. (I'M ASKING FOR EVERYONE TO READ AND REPOST). Our men and women in forces need our support and üôè along with our Chief in Command."	2017-08-16T17:30:10+0000	25

When I first heard of him I had such contempt for him. Of course a lot of what I THOUGHT I knew about Trump was propaganda from the Mainstream Media. But this man seemed unduly proud with a crude and crass mouth in any case. I was quite impressed with his fair treatment of Carson in the election debates  while people like Cruz crushed and stabbed to the frontlines. His past has issues....but who doesn't have past issues??? What I was concerned about was his current mouth status and pride. I voted for him....and WOW. This man now has my UTMOST respect. He has shown remarkable improvement in his language, yet he has lost NONE of his courage in telling it like it is and avoiding political correctness. Trump is a man of the people. And it has made everyone in power hate him. The MSM has incessantly spewed hate rhetoric with zero to no logical or factual backing. There is no reason to the hatred of the leaders either. They do not CARE about the common American. They care about their money, power, and selves. Trump has shown me that to condemn a man because I do not like that he divorced or he has crass language is naive. This man has more integrity and true patriotism and care for his fellow Americans in his blood than 90% of our leaders. And boy, does that man have a tough hide!!!! Trump is a FIGHTER. #respect"	2017-08-16T18:21:22+0000	16

Today, on the radio, a man who was there said that yes, they, the white supremists had a permit.  They were met with people who were wearing masks (WHICH IS A FELONY.) And, they had clubs with flags on top of the clubs.   In other words the horrible rioters already there knew they were coming, and were waiting for them.   The Democrat Governor of the state and the Democrat mayor of the state could have ordered the police to stop the agitators.... who had no permits.   This must stop President Trump.   We must not let the Democrats and their hired thugs get away with anymore of this chaos and destruction.   The people who caused this need to be rounded up, and jailed, and fined.   There MUST BE  consequences for their behavior.   If not, this sort of thing will continue.   The Democrats most likely hired these people to go against those who had applied for a permit.    They easily could find this out because the ones who wanted to demonstrate peacefully were granted their permit. This stuff is really depressing to those of us who are conservative and especially those of us who stand for freedom    And, especially if we are from the South, and proud of our heritage.

Kim of North Korea has more respect for President Trump than all those hating him saying he is wrong for being observant and showing impartiality to all U.S. Citizens.   If it were the N.K. Constitution, he could be partial like all these Haters want, but this Country is governed by the United States Constitution, which President Trump lives by which does not allow the Partiality to Citizens like all those haters want.  This is America, not North Korea.  If All those that think President Trump acted wrong and is talking wrong want what they want -they should go to North Korea or it's equivalent, and enjoy their wishes.   America is not a Nazi Country.  It is not a Communist Country.  Everyone has a right to impartiality under the laws.  They can do Nazi Marches, if they do them legally.  They can do Communist Marches, if they do them legally.  Such is the Freedom in America.   -But, so many that say Our President showed Immoral conduct by standing with Our Constitution.  Just Amazing!    To say he should be Partial to all because one person did an illegal act, appears just as much immoral as all which happened in the Nazi Germany of the past.   Trump cannot be wrong by standing with the United States Constitution.  That one person illegally Killed one person and hurt others.  Even U.S. law says he has rights to a fair Impartial Trial -and so many in good positions Convict President Trump without Trial.  More than amazing!
